                                    There are more people backpacking today than ever before. And the jump in number of hikers, especially women, shows no signs of abating anytime soon.

                                <p>
                                    Unlike more traditional sports, which advantage men, climbing is a relatively level playing field. Which is all the more reason to get out and get after it.

                                    You have to pack (and often purchase) a lot of gear for a ski trip, no matter if it’s a week-long vacation or weekend escape. From bulky ski boots to large pieces of outerwear, hard-to-pack helmets, and your actual equipment (skis, poles, and snowboards!), there are too many items on the checklist to count.

                                    Skiers get a lot of advice: on gear, technique, resorts, travel. And though I don’t mean to be sexist, there are a few tidbits that seem more relevant to women than they are to men. So I thought I’d capture some of them here before the new season starts.

                                    One thing the ski resorts in the East definitely have going for them: most are just a stone’s throw from major metro areas and hubs and offer easy access. We know traffic can be just as much of an issue as out West, but on the whole, there are plenty of ski areas in the East that make for a quick day trip.
