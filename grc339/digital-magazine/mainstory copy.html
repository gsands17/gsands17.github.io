                            <h2>The Best Women’s All-Mountain Skis of 2023</h2>

                                <h3>These skis are designed from their cores out to deliver the perfect balance of edge control and playfulness</h3>

                                <h4>August 30, 2022 | Jenny Wiegand</h4>
                    
                                <p> The best all-mountain skis can tear up the groomed, demolish chutes with ease, and eat bumps for breakfast. A wider waist and more tip rocker make these skis party in the front, business underfoot, and capable in everything but the deepest powder. This roundup of women’s all-mountain skis is for ladies who explore all aspects of the mountain, from frontside groomers to tracked-out bowls, and everything in between. If you’re seeking one pair of planks to do it all—and do it all well—these versatile all-mountain skis with a little more underfoot will help you tackle the whole mountain, whatever the conditions.</p>

                                <h2>How to Use These Ski Reviews</h2>

                                <p>The following skis appear in ranked order, with the ski that tested best at our 2023 gear test in Sun Valley, Idaho listed at the top. At the top of each ski review, we list the ski’s overall score, a product of how 8 female testers scored the ski across nine different skills categories. SKI’s scoring system exists to determine and call attention to the skis that most impressed our testers, a crew of ski industry professionals and advanced and expert skiers from across the country.</p>

                                <p>We believe these skis set the benchmark for what an all-mountain ski is designed to do. That said, remember that ski testing (and skiing) is somewhat subjective. While we’re big fans of the category-winning Blizzard Sheeva 9, it may not be the best choice for every skier. So don’t just look at a ski’s score—read our testers’ feedback to understand the nuances of each ski and who it’s best suited to. Otherwise, you might wind up with a great ski, just not the right ski for you.</p>

                                <p>Looking for the Black Pearl 97? You won’t find it on this list. Instead, allow us to introduce you to this year’s chart-topping women’s all-mountain ski: the more freeride-oriented Blizzard Sheeva 9. Cut from the same cloth as Blizzard’s popular unisex Rustler line but with a lighter core, it features the same construction designed to focus more on performance off-trail than on groomers. And that’s exactly where the Sheeva 9 shines, with testers praising the ski’s ability to plow over and through variable snow conditions above all else. That said, it’s just as comfortable on groomers and hard snow, and its balance of skills and perfect mix of dependability and energy are what make it the category winner. Intermediates will find it an approachable and confidence-boosting all-mountain tool, so long as they size down. In the longer lengths, the Sheeva 9 packs a punch best suited to experts willing to dial it up to 11. “A super-dependable ski you can reach for in all conditions and not be let down,” said East Coast-based tester Avery Pesce.</p>
                    

                                
                                <h3>No. 2: Head Kore 91 W</h3>  
                                <p>If we had to choose just one ski to universally recommend to women—no matter their ability or where they ski—the Head Kore 91 W might be it. Thanks to a lightweight caruba/poplar core and moderate tip and tail rocker, this ski is incredibly agile, energetic, and just so easy to swing around, making it the perfect playmate in moguls and glades. For a ski with no Titanal, the Kore 91 W also holds its own under expert pressure, and testers say it won’t let you down even when conditions get sketchy. One little shortcoming: It does have a speed limit, and because it doesn’t have metal in it, it’s not the most natural carver on hard snow. But as a playful, user-friendly, and versatile all-mountain tool, this ski is hard to top. “An intermediate-level damp ski or a playful cheater for advanced skiers,” summed up Ariella Gintzler, one of our more petite female testers.</p>
                                
                                <h3>No. 3: Salomon QST Lumen 98</h3>

                                <p>This ski blew the rest in this category out of the water in the Playfulness, Quickness, and Forgiveness departments, so if those are your jam, pull the trigger. There must be magic in the poplar wood core, because the Salomon QST Lumen 98 majorly impressed testers with its pop and pizazz—traits that have been hard to come by in some Salomon skis, which can feel a little dead inside. But not the QST Lumen 98. When asked about the ski’s weakness, a common response was, “It’s too fun.” Don’t let that fool you into thinking it isn’t dependable or serious enough for experts, though. True, it’s not the most stable at speed, but it will perform just as happily and intuitively for intermediates as it will for advanced skiers. “98 Lumen? More like 98,000 lumens—it’s so energetic,” said Erika Northrop, tester and hardgoods buyer for Christy ski shop in Taos, N.M. “Feels more at home in soft snow, but will show ya a good time on hardpack if you promise her a good time in the trees later.</p>
                                
                                <h3>No. 4: Armada Reliance 92 Ti</h3>
                                
                                <p>You’re right to expect playfulness from an Armada ski, but you’d be wrong to think this is a noodly park stick best suited to beginners and intermediates. The new generation of Armada skis means business, and that’s especially true of the Armada Reliance 92 Ti. A narrower all-mountain tool featuring a poppy caruba core, articulated Titanal banding, elongated tip rise, and a fully cambered tail, it was built to bite into groomers and firm snow as well as plow through crud. Testers were also quite impressed by the ski’s playfulness and energy, and because it’s both a high performer on hard snow and fun in variable conditions, testers named the Reliance 92 Ti the most versatile in the category. It really comes alive for experts who know how to drive a ski. Intermediates may not find it the most forgiving, but they’ll benefit from all this ski has to teach them. “Does everything and does it well,” said tester and SKI editor, Jenny Wiegand. “An incredible all-mountain choice for strong intermediates to experts.</p>
                                
                                <h3>No. 5: Nordica Santa Ana 93</h3>

                                <p>It’s hard to find true weaknesses in the Nordica Santa Ana 93, a jack of all trades that performs on hard snow and in soft, in variable terrain and on groomers. Featuring a healthy mix of wood and intentionally placed metal, as well as both tip and tail rocker, it was built from the inside out to charge the whole mountain. Pressure the front of this ski and it will respond immediately, which makes it a great choice for advanced and expert skiers. Don’t mistake responsiveness for quickness, though; it takes a skilled skier to get the Santa Ana 93 to fire off short-swing turns. Though it’s not the most user-friendly or playful ski in the bunch, it’s dependable and stable—a great choice for women who gravitate toward a ski with some backbone. The perfect daily driver for the advanced New England or resort skier” said Pesce.  “Smooth, stable, and reliable.  Ladies who prefer medium to long radius turns will love the dependability of this ski.</p>
                            
                                <h3>No. 6: Stöckli Nela 96</h3>
                            
                               <p>This ski didn’t repeat the category win this year, but let’s be clear: Testers still love it. Like all Stöckli thoroughbreds, it rails on hardpack and on edge, but it’s much more versatile than that. The ski’s tip and tail rocker encourage smearing and pivoting, which makes skiing bumps and tackling chop not only doable, but enjoyable, earning it the highest scores in Crud Performance. Add to that Stöckli’s Titanal technology and a beefy sidewall, and the Nela 96 offers up one smooth ride when you crank up the speed or the going gets tough. However, it falls a little short in approachability. While it’s definitely more user-friendly than the Stöckli skis of yore, it’s still not the most playful, intuitive, or forgiving. If you’re ready to drive a sports car, give ’er; otherwise, you’ll just be holding her back. “For the hard-charging advanced or expert New England skier who wants one ski to handle everything,” said Pesce.</p>
                              
                               <h3>No. 7:   Völkl Secret 96</h3>
                                
                               <figure>

                               </figure>

                               <p>Völkl’s Tailored Titanal Frame, which adjusts the amount of metal around the edges according to the ski’s length to ensure an appropriate flex, has made all the difference in how approachable and fun the Völkl Secret 96 is. But it’s never been more important to get the right ski length for your physique and ability. Skiers who normally prefer a 170cm-plus ski really enjoyed the Secret 96 in a shorter length, calling it playful and energetic, yet still stable and dependable. Testers who skied it at 170cm found it less agile and snappy, but raved about its knack for digging in on hardpack. The lesson here: The Secret 96 is a versatile all-mountain ski no matter how you slice it. If you prefer a ski with some pop and pizazz, size down. If you’re an expert who values stability, you’ll dig the dampness of the Secret 96 in the longer lengths. “Surprised by the mix of stability and energy,” said tester and Jackson Hole local, Lily Krass.</p>
                            
                               <h3>No. 8:  4FRNT MSP CC</h3>
                        
                               <p>This ski has been around for years and is an all-mountain staple. Every season, though, we have a few testers who have never skied the 4FRNT MSP CC, then go home ready to buy it. This year, that tester was Pesce, an experienced hardgoods buyer and skier from the East: “First glance at flex, sidecut, and profile, I thought this was going to be a twitchy, chattery little whip—but boy, was I wrong! Smooth as butter and fun as hell. This ski blew me away!” Those who’ve had the privilege of skiing the MSP CC in years past continue to love it for its stability and dependability, no matter the conditions or terrain. Thanks to a poplar wood core reinforced with a Titanal laminate, this ski is damp without feeling overly stiff or burly, which makes it one of the best for charging crud and manky snow. It also holds an edge nicely on groomers, though it does this better on softer snow than on true boilerplate. One shortcoming: You need some skill and weight to appreciate its greatness. Because it is one of the stiffer, wider skis in the category, petite testers didn’t feel like they could tap into the MSP CC’s energy, and found it a little boring as a result. But stronger, more athletic skiers called the ski one of the best all-rounders in the category for hard-charging women. “Whips around trees easily, is fun in the bumps, and holds up on a rail turn,” said tester Michelle Nicholson, a Jackson Hole local. “Outstanding women’s all-mountain ski that charges the terrain top to bottom.”</p>
                        
                               <h3>No. 9: Elan Ripstick 94 W</h3>
                        
                               <p>Some testers still question the need for Elan’s Amphibio technology—where each ski has a cambered inside and rockered outside edge and therefore becomes a dedicated “left” and “right” ski—but they don’t question the performance of the Ripstick. The Elan Ripstick 94 W is a tried-and-true all-mountain tool favored by advanced and expert women skiers who split their time evenly between groomers and crud. Testers loved how quick it was to initiate turns and get up on edge—traits that make this ski very accessible to intermediates who are still working on their skills, but ready to level up. Because it doesn’t boast a full sheet of metal, and instead uses strategically placed carbon rods to reinforce the ski’s light wood core, the Ripstick 94 W is missing the heft and dampness to crush crud and grip on hard snow like some of the other skis in this category. These weaknesses are easy to turn a blind eye to if you’re primarily in the market for a user-friendly and agile all-mountain ski, because this offering nails those skill departments. “Energetic and stable through the bumps, nimble and floaty in the trees, stable on the groomers,” said Pesce.</p>
                        

                               <h3>No. 10: K2 Mindbender 89 Ti W</h3>


                               <p>The women’s-specific K2 Mindbender 89Ti is technically new this season, though it’s based on the previous 88Ti model. This updated version features a slightly different sidecut and turning radius and increased tail rocker, but fans of the previous iteration won’t be disappointed with these changes. In fact, they make Mindbender 89Ti quicker and more user-friendly. The old model was slow to release out of a turn, but the bumped-up tail rocker in this new one takes care of that issue and makes the ski significantly more agile without sacrificing too much stability. Testers loved it in the bumps and tight terrain, where that newfound playfulness and effortless turning made life easier and more fun. But, like the old version, the Mindbender 89Ti isn’t a fan of hard snow, and the increased tail rocker makes it less stable at speed, in big arcs, and on the groomers. All this makes it a ski best suited to intermediate and advanced skiers who like to play all over the mountain—with the emphasis on “play.” “An amazing ski for the everyday skier, it does what it is told and is loose in the tail to keep things playful,” said Colorado-based tester Renée Cernichiari.</p>
